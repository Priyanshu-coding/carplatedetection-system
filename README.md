Project Overview: Number Plate Recognition
This project is designed to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images. It uses OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR for character recognition. The system preprocesses images to enhance accuracy and extracts text from the detected plates. It is an efficient tool for automating tasks like vehicle identification and tracking.
